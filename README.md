Welcome to AI Exploration Lab, a repository dedicated to the world of artificial intelligence experiments. 
Here, I embark on a journey of discovery, experimentation in the vast landscape of AI. 
Explore algorithms, dive into neural networks, and witness the magic of machine learning unfold. 
Join me in the exploration of AI technologies, share insights, 
and contribute to the collective intelligence of the AI community. 

##### Numpy array
This Python script demonstrates basic array operations using NumPy to understand array shapes.

### Logistic Regression Optimization perspective vs. sklearn notebook:

In this notebook, I aimed to provide an example of implementing loss and cost functions. Additionally, I generated a binary class dataset and performed classification using gradient descent through both iterative (loop-based) and vectorized implementations. Finally, I compared the results with the implementation provided by the scikit-learn library.

### Exploring MNIST with Keras Deep Nets and CNNs notebook:

 This notebook is inspired by the "A high-bias, low-variance introduction to Machine Learning for physicists" paper, which offers an excellent tutorial available on their GitHub repository: [mlreview_notebooks](https://github.com/drckf/mlreview_notebooks/tree/master).


### TensorFlow Zero to Hero Notebook

This notebook summarizes my learning journey from TensorFlow's tutorial series. Beginning with a single-layer, single-neuron regression model, I progressed to constructing deep neural networks for MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets.

### Autoencoders anomaly detection ECG notebook:

In this notebook, I implemented Autoencoders for anomaly detection on the ECG dataset using TensorFlow, following the example provided in the TensorFlow documentation: [Autoencoder Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/autoencoder). The approach involves training the autoencoder with normal ECG data. Subsequently, when the model predicts an unseen data point with a significant error, it signifies an anomaly.

### A deep understanding of deep learning (with Python intro)

In this repository, you'll find code snippets suffixed with 'DUDL' that gist the of the "A deep understanding of deep learning (with Python intro)" course and its exercises. This comprehensive course is designed to empower learners with a mastery of deep learning in PyTorch through an experimental and scientific approach. this course, available on Udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning_x/?couponCode=ST8MT40924
