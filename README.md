Welcome to AI Exploration Lab, a repository dedicated to the world of artificial intelligence experiments. 
Here, I embark on a journey of discovery, experimentation in the vast landscape of AI. 
Explore algorithms, dive into neural networks, and witness the magic of machine learning unfold. 
Join me in the exploration of AI technologies, share insights, 
and contribute to the collective intelligence of the AI community. 

Logistic Regression Optimization perspective vs. sklearn notebook:

In this notebook, I aimed to provide an example of implementing loss and cost functions. Additionally, I generated a binary class dataset and performed classification using gradient descent through both iterative (loop-based) and vectorized implementations. Finally, I compared the results with the implementation provided by the scikit-learn library.

 Exploring MNIST with Keras Deep Nets and CNNs notebook:

 This notebook is inspired by the "A high-bias, low-variance introduction to Machine Learning for physicists" paper, which offers an excellent tutorial available on their GitHub repository: [mlreview_notebooks](https://github.com/drckf/mlreview_notebooks/tree/master).
